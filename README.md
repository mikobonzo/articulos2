### Propose the solutions using words and diagrams. Recommendation on how to deliver solutions that can solve the problem state.

1. All the given 3 solutions implemented two-layer components. A front-end and back-end. For the reason that that if the application scales, either vertical/horizontalor  on-premise or cloud,  we do not have a tight monolithic  design that we have to dismantle.

2. Examples for CSR's are ( Javascript)
3. Examples for SSR's are (Most of these are Java based. Samples would be ZKoss and Vaadin )


### Justify your technology stack, libraries, router framework, and UI components.
1. Provided 3 implementations for a broad comparison. A React-JS + Java would be best. But a Nodejs + React is the lightest 

### Use PlantUML / or equivalent tools to create representations of the Use-Case Diagram, Component Diagram, and Deployment Diagram
1. Kindly see the pdf file. ( Solution-Design-Document-EBook-Management )
